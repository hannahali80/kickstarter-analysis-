Deliverable 3: Written Analysis of the Results

1.	Overview of Project


Purpose: The purpose of this project was to use excel tools for analyzing data to conclude and get more information on the success of the theatre. Multiple functions were used along with visual graphs to draw conclusions. 
2.	Analysis and Challenges

The overall data was good from beginning. Few columns needed to be converted such as the date in month and year format. The parent and subcategories were separated into two different columns in order to apply it to pivot table.  

3.	Result
a.	What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The first conclusion drawn is looking at the line chart the most successful plays are in the month of May while the lease successful play is in the month of December. The second conclusion is that from March to May the plays are much more successful and starts to decrease gradually from June to December. In December the theatre should close down. 

b.	What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The most successful plays are when the goal is set to less than $1000 in collection and the lease successful when goal is $45000 to $49,000. 


c.	What are some limitations of this dataset?

The limitation of the dataset could be that the theatre has provided low quality data and it may contain errors due to human errors. 
If the theatre does not have automated system to capture the data and is entered manually than there is a possibility of increased human error that can result into unreliable analysis. 

Second, other factors that played major part into the success of the plays that could either be marketing tools used that can be quantified in dollar amount to analyze better if the plays that were successful due to increased marking efforts or not. 
d.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?


More conclusions could have been drawn by using simply pie chart to show the dollar amount based on the month of the play to show financial details for other shareholders. 
A Table could be created to conclude the profit and loss based on successful and failed plays. The sum if function would be advisable and simple addition to conclude the overall loss and profit determined based on year or month.
